Vertex data header
	4 bytes - vertex group size # << 2 to get TOTAL size in bytes
	4 bytes - number of vertices
	4 bytes - related to faces # details bellow
	4 bytes - id number of a vertex group
# face value will be one of this values (1B, 4B, 5B, 1C, 4C, 5C). I don't really know what 1, 4 or 5 do but depending on if it B or C faces would need to be assigned differently.
# B: f 1 2 3, f 4 5 6, f 7 8 9, etc.
# C: f 1 2 3, f 2 4 3, f 3 4 5, f 4 6 5, etc.

Vertex data
	X(vertex group size) bytes - vertices # each vertex is four floats xyzw
	X(vertex group size) bytes - vertex normals
	X(vertex group size) bytes - texture coordinates
	X(vertex group size) bytes - unknown # brightness or specular?

Textures header
	4 bytes - number of textures
	12 bytes - 00

Texture data
# Textures are just HEP images

# For the rest I haven't dug far enough.
